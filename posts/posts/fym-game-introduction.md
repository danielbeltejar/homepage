Front Yard Monster is an exciting blend of base-building, tactical strategy, and tower defence gameplay. Inspired by the classic flash game *Backyard Monsters*, which was one of the first MMORTS games but has since been discontinued, we’re bringing this beloved style back with fresh mechanics and improvements. Join our community and help us make Front Yard Monster a hit!

The game is currently in development and will be released first on web browsers, with plans for mobile releases on both Android and iOS in the future.

## Models and Characters

All 3D models in the game are created from scratch using Blender, with careful attention paid to animation and rotation to ensure high-quality visuals. We chose this sprite-based approach to maintain a classic gaming atmosphere while avoiding potential performance issues that might arise from using 3D polygonal models, especially on mobile devices.

While most of our models draw inspiration from *Backyard Monsters*, we’re continuously working to enhance them and introduce innovative mechanics not found in the original game.

## Game Technicals

Front Yard Monster is built using the Unity game engine. The client-side code is entirely written in C#, ensuring smooth performance across platforms. On the server side, we’ve implemented microservices for scalability and flexibility as the player base grows.

For data storage, we’re using MongoDB and Regis to handle non-relative databases and provide instant data streams. Anti-cheating measures are in place on both client and server sides, with ongoing consideration for potential penalties for players attempting to exploit the game.

## Game Introduction

Embark on your adventure with Front Yard Monster by learning the basics of gameplay through resource collection. Resources can be gathered from your own bases or by raiding others. As you progress, you’ll unlock improvements that enhance your gameplay experience.

Builder units, each with unique skills, will play a crucial role in advancing your strategy. These builders can be exchanged with other players for valuable resources and new opportunities. Additionally, you’ll have the chance to unlock and upgrade creatures, including the ability to mutate them for powerful new abilities.

Once you’ve mastered the game, you’ll be able to conquer other bases and explore entirely new types of bases that offer fresh challenges and rewards. Whether it’s constructing new buildings or discovering rare creatures, there’s always something new to achieve in Front Yard Monster.
