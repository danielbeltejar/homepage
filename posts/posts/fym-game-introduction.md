## Models and Characters

Every 3D model in Front Yard Monster is created using Blender, emphasizing high-quality animations and smooth rotations. By adopting a sprite-based approach, we capture the classic visual feel while ensuring optimal performance—particularly on mobile devices. Although *Backyard Monsters* serves as our foundational inspiration, we continuously enhance these assets with unique designs and innovative mechanics.

## Technical Overview

Built on the Unity platform, Front Yard Monster leverages C# for its client-side operations, ensuring reliability and fluidity across various devices. The server architecture employs microservices to facilitate scalability and flexibility as the player base grows. Data management is powered by MongoDB and Redis, providing efficient, real-time data streams. Robust anti-cheat systems are implemented on both the client and server sides, safeguarding fair play throughout the game.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Players embark on their journey by collecting essential resources, which serve as the foundation for base expansion and defense. Strategic deployment of builder units, each possessing unique abilities, is crucial for progressing through the game. These builders can be exchanged for valuable resources, unlocking new opportunities for enhancing your base and creatures. As players advance, opportunities to mutate and upgrade creatures add depth, forcing strategic decision-making to conquer rival bases and explore new challenges.
